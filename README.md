# ML_SimpleJump
Simple unity ml project where an agent (cube) learns to jump

It was my first ML unity project. I followed an online guide in order to understand how the toolkit works.
Each cube has a behaviour and detects the obstacle which it is supposed to jump over, as well a "wall" above, the road and a "wall" connected to the obstacle (so we can give him a reward for jumping over)

To run the learning process i create an environment through anaconda.
The rates were not good tho.
